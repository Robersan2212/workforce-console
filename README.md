# Workforce Console - C# Database Application

## Overview

As a software engineer passionate about expanding my technical skills, I developed this Workforce Console application to deepen my understanding of modern C# development practices, database integration, and object-oriented programming principles. This project represents my commitment to continuous learning and practical application of software engineering concepts.

The Workforce Console is a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) application built in C# that demonstrates full-stack development capabilities by integrating a SQLite database with Entity Framework Core. The application provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee and department data, showcasing real-world database management scenarios.

My purpose for developing this software was to master C# syntax and conventions while building a practical application that demonstrates database connectivity, exception handling, input validation, and modular software architecture. This project serves as a foundation for understanding enterprise-level application development patterns and best practices.
